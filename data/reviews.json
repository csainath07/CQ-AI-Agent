      "feedback": "Okay, I've reviewed the code diff. Here's my assessment:\n\n**1. Code Quality Score: 6/10**\n\n**2. Constructive Feedback:**\n\n*   **Small Scope, Limited Impact:** This is a very small diff.  It changes a few strings. As such, the code quality impact is limited.\n*   **Removal of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`:** The removal of the `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is generally positive.  This practice should *always* be avoided unless absolutely necessary.  It's a major security risk.  Without more context, I have to assume its removal is a positive change.  *However*, where did the `name` variable go?  Why was it there in the first place?  These are important questions.\n*   **Minor Typographical Change:**  The change from ` [EDITED]` to `[Edited]` is primarily a cosmetic one. While consistency matters, the impact of this change is minimal.  It *implies* that the user is supposed to edit the file.\n*   **Lack of Context:**  Without understanding the full context of the `name` variable or the purpose of this page, it's difficult to provide more specific or helpful feedback. Was `name` user-supplied? Is this a template meant to be customized?\n\n**3. Suggested Improvements:**\n\n*   **Investigate `name` Removal:** The *most important* suggestion is to understand the context and implications of removing the `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`.  Why was it there? Where did the data come from?  Was it properly escaped?  If the `name` variable held user-supplied data, its removal is good. If `name` had a legitimate purpose and simply *removing* it breaks the page, we'll need to replace it with a *safe* alternative. A better approach would be to encode it using `encodeURIComponent()` and use it safely in a template literal.\n\n*   **Consider i18n:** The `[Edited]` change implies a template to be customized. Consider a basic i18n (internationalization) approach even for small projects.  Instead of hardcoding `[Edited]`, use a placeholder or a dedicated i18n library to handle translations in the future.  This makes the code more adaptable.\n\n*   **Add a Comment (Potentially):** If the `[Edited]` string is there as a marker *specifically* to show where the developer should customize the file, consider adding a comment block above the `<p>` tag explaining this explicitly:\n\n    ```jsx\n    <p>\n      {/*\n          This is the default text for this page.  Replace it with your\n          own content.\n      */}\n      <code className={styles.code}> src/pages/index.tsx</code>[Edited]\n    </p>\n    ```\n    This makes the intention crystal clear.  Remove the comment after the change.\n\n*   **Linting/Formatting:** Ensure the code adheres to consistent linting and formatting rules (e.g., using Prettier and ESLint).\n\n**In summary:**\n\nThe removal of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is a big potential win, assuming it was a risk. However, it's crucial to understand *why* it was there in the first place and ensure that the removal doesn't break functionality. The typographical change is minor.  The biggest improvement would be to better document the file's purpose and suggest a more robust approach to managing strings (i18n).\n"
